"""
Streamlit application for monitoring cryptocurrency markets in realâ€‘time and
detecting emerging 5%+ price surges.  The app fetches price data from the
public Coingecko API at regular intervals, computes simple momentumâ€‘based
features and extrapolates potential gains over the next 30 minutes.  It
surfaces the top five coins with the highest projected percentage increase
and displays them in a table along with their projected gain.  A history of
prices is maintained in the session state so that trends can be visualised
and used in the prediction logic.  The dashboard automatically refreshes
every minute to provide continuously updated insights.

The prediction algorithm implemented here is intentionally lightweight and
heuristic.  It examines the shortâ€‘term returns of each coin (over the last
1, 5 and 15 minute windows) and projects them forward to estimate a 30
minute gain.  Coins whose projected gain exceeds five percent are
highlighted.  In a production setting you might replace this logic with
a more sophisticated machine learning model trained on historical data.
